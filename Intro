		<p>At ease,  Matrix - ian. You are not engaging in anything illicit and fun,  just innovative and a bit" techie". Well,  check your individual country's law books,  because some of those in power - and that's  a hard look at Russia and Spain - want to make you feel like a criminal for being a part of the growing user base of Bitcoin. A user base that also powers the network and gives it value,  all team like and efficient. OK,  that is your computers,  but YOU  ya pretty bastard   are the cutting edge thinker who downloaded the software that has bought you a couple gift cards and a spool of ink I'm  guessing,  as you get the faucet tour and Satoshi shower on your way into Uncle Betty's world.</p></br></ind><p>This next step should be done in your <ital>big boy pants.</ital> This isn't a men club,  or a woman club - it is kind of a geek club,  but deep down,  we are all geeks.  Except me,  but especially you.  Anyway,  when the idea that America can't outright put the squeeze on one central snitch in this network like it can in it's own financial arena,  the allure of 3d slots,  bitcoin sports books,  poker and a big weird wheel of Roulette may have you longing for those glamorous beeps and boops of online gaming.

OK,  it knows red tape,  but with a system built on peer2peer  networking and Alien hieroglyphics  we don't worry if MasterCard or Visa will kick down your scratch,  because your Uncle Bitty will! America,  anonymous betting with intangible "coins" worth $700 at the current moment? This was tailor made for the gray area dwelling,  conspiracy theory solving,  lunch at your mother's on Sunday crowd, so get you some and see how you do. Keep reading,  there's a tutorial somewhere in here.
